## What is git ?

Git is a tool that helps people keep track of changes to files, especially when working on projects like coding. It allows you to save different versions of your work, so you can go back to earlier versions if needed.

## Think of Git like this:

**Version history:** It keeps a history of all the changes you've made to your project. If you make a mistake, you can go back and fix it by using an earlier version.

**Collaboration:** When multiple people are working on the same project, Git helps them work together without messing up each other's work. Everyone can make their changes, and then combine them when ready.

**Branches:** You can create different "branches" to work on new ideas without affecting the main project. Once the idea is ready, you can merge it back into the main project.
